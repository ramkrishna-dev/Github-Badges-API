# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to security@code-xon.com instead of creating a public issue.

## Security Considerations

- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- GitHub tokens are optional and should be kept secret
- No user data is stored; all requests are stateless
- SVG output is sanitized to prevent XSS

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate your help in keeping our users safe. We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 7 days.
